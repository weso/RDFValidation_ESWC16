SHACL by Example

ShEx vs SHACL



Notes about SHACL

- Terminology:

A constraint component represents a part of a constraint that is determined by the values <of> one or more ...

- minCount, maxCount

Would it be possible to generalize them to node constraints?

Example:

# there must be between 5 and 10 people
:Person a sh:Shape ;
  sh:constraint [
   sh:minCount 5 ;
   sh:maxCount 10 
  ] 

- datatypeIn the table uses datatype instead of datatypeIn

- sh:name is only available for property constraints? 
    and not about inverse property constraints? or about shapes?
	
Questions to Eric

- Combined value constraints in Primer, does it work in ShExDemo?
